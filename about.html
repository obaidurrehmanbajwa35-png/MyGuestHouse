            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Al Bahr  which means “The Sea” in Arabic  started with a simple idea. We wanted to create a place that feels connected to Qatar’s roots while still offering the comfort and calm of island living.

                Our guest house is inspired by the history of the coast. The design reflects the old watchtowers that once stood along the shoreline, and you’ll notice touches of traditional Sadu patterns woven into the details. These elements aren’t just decoration ,they’re part of the story we grew up with and wanted to share.

                For us, hospitality is personal. Al Bahr isn’t a large resort, and that’s intentional. We prefer it this way. It allows us to welcome each guest properly, to create a space that feels more like staying with family than booking a room.

                We’ve chosen our décor carefully, working with local pieces and materials whenever possible. We also do our best to keep our operations plastic free, because the sea around us isn’t just our view , it’s our responsibility.

                Al Bahr is simply our way of honoring the coast, the culture, and the people who visit us..
